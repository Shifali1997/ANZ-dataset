# ANZ-dataset
The dataset contains 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

Task1(Exploratory Data Analysis)-
Here I used pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn for analysis and data visualization. I did grouping with respect to the customers to understand about their transactions. Analysed how transactions have taken place during the weekdays and hours of the day. Divided the dataset into three months and analysed transactions of each month.

Task2(Predictive Analytics)-
Here I used Linear Regression and Decision tree regression to find the annual salary of each customer. I have added some more attributes to reduce the rmse score.
